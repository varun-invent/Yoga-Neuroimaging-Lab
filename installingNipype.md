# For installing NiPype on cerebrum

* Please login using firefox in cerebrum. You can either do it using VNC or `ssh -X <userID>`. In case you are encountering an error while running firefox, please follow the following steps:
    * Try `killall firefox-bin` or `killall firefox`
    * If it still doesn't work, try deleting **profiles.ini** file in the folder `~/.mozilla/` and restart terminal. 
    * It might happen that you still get an error. But you can run firefox GUI now and set the proxy preferences and then you'll be able to login.

* Please keep this window open and now you can work in another terminal window.

* You can go through the guidelines given [here](http://miykael.github.io/nipype-beginner-s-guide/installation.html). The best way is to install it after installing Anaconda3. 

Good luck!
